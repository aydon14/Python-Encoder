| 1.  Download release: https://github.com/aydon14/Python-Encoder/releases     |
| 2.  Extract files into any folder (Portable installation)                    |
| 3.  You do NOT need to install python for this to work. (Windows only)       |
|                                                                              |

| The program can encrypt files AND folders with a given codec. The codecs are |
|    meant to be dynamic, so you can add or remove ones you don't need. All    |
|  codecs are in the codec folder. Do NOT remove '_internal' in your release   |
|  folder, or else the program might not work. The program may require admin   |
|   priveleges in order to edit system files that require extra permission.    |
|    You aren't required to enter files, if you want, you can enter text to    |
|             encrypt. That's all. Internet privacy rules! - Aydon             |

|                               Note: -h says to use encode/decode, but        |
|                               use encrypt/decrypt instead.                   |

|   Note: You can manually enter text if you don't use -in-dir and -out-dir.   |
